Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.\",\n", "file_location": "https://git.unbiased.cc/unbiased-intelligence-hub/emotion_detector_text/-/tree/master/Data", "use_cases": "Emotion recognition from text", "file_columns": ["text", "emotion"], "file_size": "47.6 MB", "total_data_samples": "416809", "labels": ["sadness", "joy", "love", "anger", "fear", "surprise"], "data_distribution": {"joy": "141067", "sadness": "121187", "anger": "57317", "fear": "47712", "love": "34554", "surprise": "14972"}}
